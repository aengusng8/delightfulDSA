This repository has been updating to roughly 250 solutions before December 2021, and I divided them into two groups: intermediate and advanced problems.

# The group of intermediate problems comprises 15 topics:
  1. Dynamic Array & String
  2. Algorithmic Complexity
  3. Applied Sorting
  4. Stack & Queue
  5. Breadth-first Search (BFS)
  6. Depth-first Search	(DFS)
  7. Heap
  8. Dijkstra
  9. Bellman-Ford
  10. Floyd-Warshall
  11. Binary Search
  12. Binary Search Tree - Set Map
  13. Trie
  14. Minimum Spanning Tree
  15. Disjoint Set Union

# The group of advanced problems comprises 6 topics:
  1. Topological Sort 
  2. Bit Manipulation
  3. Backtracking 
  4.Divide & Conquer
  5. Greedy 
  6. Number Theory
  7. Hash table 
  8.Dynamic Programming
  9. Knuth-Morris-Pratt 
  10. 10. Segment Tree
